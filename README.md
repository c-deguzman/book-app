# Book App Epsilon
 _by Christopher DeGuzman_
 
Book App Epsilon is a web-based voting application. Built with:

  - MongoDB
  - Express
  - React
  - Node
 
Application allows users to search and upload books they wish to trade. Users are able to create trade requests for other posters. Users may respond to their trade requests by either declining (deleting the request) or accepting (removing their book listing and removing all other requests made for the book). A user may delete their book listing at any time.

Big thanks to the publicly available OpenLibrary API and GoogleBooks API for their ISBN services.
